# HOUSE RENT PREDICTION
# Introduction
As international or domestic students, many students arrive from various locations and countries,
making it difficult for them to estimate the rent they must pay. Moreover, each student has
unique requirements and options. As a result, their calculations for budgeting and spending could
be challenging. Since housing is one of the most important basic requirements, we decided to do
an analysis that will be useful for the current students as well as future cohorts in determining the
proper rent price that is most suitable for them in order to attend the university. Each student has
a unique background and specific preference. This is why we chose this dataset, which included
characteristics such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, furnished options, laundry, parking
options, pets allowed, smoking allowed or not, wheelchair accessibility, or even electric vehicle
charging capabilities. We believe that these characteristics could be the factor contributing to the
rental price.


# Questions to Investigate
1. Which residential type is the most suitable to rent based on the individual requirements

2. According to the students' individual needs and amenities, which price is the most
suitable? (Random Forest Regression and XgBoost Regression)
3. With respect to price and amenities, which region to expect? In addition, which features
play an important role in prediction. (Random Forest Classifier)
4. What is the expected number of beds based on the region and amenities? (Random Forest
Classifier)
